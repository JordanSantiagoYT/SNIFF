	How to use the preset file to convert json?
	
	you can put comments with //, /* or */.
	i recommend you press TAB before writing comment blocks.
	
	First line is for the song name, it's used to make the file name. (Default is input file name)

	Second line is for BPM. You can leave it empty if a FLP file was selected.

	Third line is for needsVoices, it can be Y or N. (Default is N)

	Forth line is for player1. (Default is "bf")

	Fifth line is for player2. (Default is "dad")

	Sixth line is for gfVersion. (Default is "gf")

	Seventh line is for stage. (Default is "stage")

	Eighth line is for speed. (Default is bpm value divided by 50)
	The scroll speed of a song of any difficulty level is set by this value.

	Ninth line is for song credits.
	(NOTE: Only works on JS Engine!)

	Example:
		bopeebo // song name
		102.0 // bpm
		true // needsVoices
		bf // player1
		dad // player2
		gf // gfVersion
		stage // stage
		1.0 // speed
